Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 152  < max pop len bins: 200; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Information: Std_yrmax=-1 in starter, so no variance output for forecast quantities after endyr+1 
Note 3 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Note 4 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
